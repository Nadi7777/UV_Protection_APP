# UV_Protection_APP
This is my capstone project . This app is set up for checking the UV of your location , saying what you should do depending on UV's strength.
But if you exceed limitation UV api Which is applied for this app, you have to wait for one day. That api allows 50 request per day.This is API that I 
applied https://www.openuv.io/

To run app cmd >> node index.js
